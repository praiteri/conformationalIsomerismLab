This repository contains the input files for the computational work described in:
"Revisiting the conformational isomerism of di-haloethanes; a hybrid computational and experimental laboratory for the undergraduate curriculum"
published in ACS Physical Chemistry AU 

SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
All the QM calculations have been performed with ORCA 5.0.2
All the MD simulations have been performed with LAMMPS and the input files were tested 
with the "release" version downloaded from github on 23rd November 2022.
LAMMPS must be compiled with these extra packages:
  * KSPACE
  * MOLECULE
  * EXTRA-FIX
  * EXTRA-DUMP
  * EXTRA-MOLECULE

PROVIDED FILES
The folder "docs" contains the instructions to the students, which include
  * Introduction to the problem
  * Short introduction to the computational methods
  * Detailed instructions for running the calculations on a LINUX VM
  * Instructions to run the experiments using the micro-RAMAN scanning probe
  * Details about the assessment

The folder "geometries" contains the atomic coordinates for the DFT and Molecualr Dynamics calculations
